# Hello SQLite!

This project includes a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) server script that uses a persistent [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database. The app also includes a front-end web page that connects to the database. The user can see the current data and submit new records to the database. 📊

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `server.js`: The Node.js server script for your new site. The JavaScript defines the endpoints in the site back-end.

← `public/style.css`:

← `src/tbd`:

← `.env`:

When the app runs Glitch builds the database:

← `sqlite.db` is created and placed in the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console by selecting __Tools__ >  __Logs__.
