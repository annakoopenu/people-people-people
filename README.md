# Hello SQLite!

This project includes a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) server script that uses a persistent [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) database. The app also includes a front-end web page that connects to the database. The user can see the current data and submit new records to the database.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `server.js`: 


When the app runs Glitch builds the database:

← `sqlite.db` is created and placed in the `.data` folder, a hidden directory whose contents aren’t copied when a project is remixed. You can see the contents of `.data` in the console by selecting __Tools__ >  __Logs__.

On the front-end,

- Edit `views/index.html`,  `public/style.css`, and `public/client.js`
- Drag in `assets`, like images or music, to add them to your project

On the back-end,

- Your app starts at `server.js`
- Add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- Safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy.
